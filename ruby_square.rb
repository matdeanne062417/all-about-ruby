# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
# ===========
# Task:

# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number: return true if it's a square number, otherwise return false.

# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
# =======

# Examples

# -1 => false
# 0 => true
# 3 => false
# 4 => true
# 25 => true
# 26 => false
